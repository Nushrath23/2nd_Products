Question:

Suppose you are building a simple inventory management system for a store that sells various types of products. Each product can 
be categorized as either "Electronics" or "Clothing." Both electronics and clothing have some common attributes, such as a product
 code and price, but they also have specific attributes. Electronics have a warranty period (in months), while clothing 
 has a size (S, M, L, XL). Implement an object-oriented program in C++ to model this scenario.

Your program should include the following classes:

Product: The base class that contains common attributes like productCode (string) and price (float).

Electronics: A derived class from Product that includes an additional attribute warrantyPeriod (integer, months).

Clothing: Another derived class from Product that includes an additional attribute size (char, S/M/L/XL).

Your program should allow the following operations:

Create objects of type Electronics and Clothing.
Set and retrieve the attributes of each object.
Display the details of each product, including the common attributes and the specific attributes.
Demonstrate your program by creating instances of both Electronics and Clothing objects, setting their attributes, and displaying 
their details.

Bonus (Optional): Implement error handling to ensure that the warranty period for electronics is not negative, and the size for 
clothing is one of the specified values (S, M, L, XL).

In your answer, provide the C++ code for the classes, object creation, input, output, and inheritance.
